# Swapp

A school project made with ASP.NET Core MVC.

MADE BY: Vaiva Ignataviciute, Albina Mrazova, Vidas Stirbys and Jakob Kilias Svenningsen

The idea was to create a website where you will be able to swap your own stuff with other people. 
It’s a platform where people can gather all the stuff they don’t want anymore and exchange it for stuff that other people don’t want anymore. 
 
Using the Identity framework we enabled sign up and login. The user data is stored in a relational database managed with SQL Server.
After a user has signed up set user wil then  be able to add products with 3 images, a description and a category.
